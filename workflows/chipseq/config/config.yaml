chipseq:
  # The peak_calling section is a list of dicts, each one defining a single
  # chipseq peak-calling run. The output will be created according to `label`
  # and `algorithm`. There will be at least a file
  # `<peaks_dir>/<algorithm>/<label>/peaks.bed`; other files may be created
  # depending on the algorithm.
  #
  # Note that this directory structure means you can have the same label for
  # different peak-callers to more easily compare them.
  #
  # The `ip` and `control` sections expect names found in the "label" column of
  # the sampletable. This column describes the technical replicates, and the
  # merging step of the workflow merges and de-dupes appropriately so that the
  # peak callers only see BAMs with all duplicates removed.
  #
  # Each wrapper is built to accept either single or multiple BAMs and output
  # at least a BED file of peaks.
